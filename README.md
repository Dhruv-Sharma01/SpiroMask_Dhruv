# Sampling Rate Analysis

The `sampling_rate_analysis.py` script determines the sampling rate of an audio file using the [librosa](https://librosa.org/) library and prints the result.

## Usage

```bash
python sampling_rate_analysis.py path/to/audio/file.wav
```

Replace `path/to/audio/file.wav` with the actual path to your audio file.

# Frequency Range Identification

The `frequency_range.py` script analyzes the spectral centroid of an audio file to identify the frequency range where prominent information, such as breathing sounds, is present.

## Usage

```bash
python frequency_range.py path/to/audio/file.wav
```

Replace `path/to/audio/file.wav` with the actual path to your audio file.

# Dependencies
